# Getting Started with Functional Programming

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Let's explore how you can introduce functional programming principles into your codebase.

## Key Concepts in Functional Programming

### Pure Functions

A pure function:
1. Always returns the same output for the same input
2. Has no side effects (doesn't modify external state)

```typescript
// Not pure - relies on external state
let counter = 0;
function incrementCounter() {
  counter++;
  return counter;
}

// Pure - result depends only on input
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Immutability

In functional programming, data structures are immutable - once created, they cannot be changed:

```typescript
// Non-functional approach
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // Mutates the original array

// Functional approach
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4]; // Creates a new array
```

### Function Composition

Building complex operations by combining simpler functions:

```typescript
const double = (x: number): number => x * 2;
const increment = (x: number): number => x + 1;

// Compose functions manually
const doubleAndIncrement = (x: number): number => increment(double(x));

// Using composition helpers
const compose = <T>(f: (x: T) => T, g: (x: T) => T) => (x: T): T => f(g(x));
const incrementAndDouble = compose(double, increment);

console.log(incrementAndDouble(3)); // (3+1)*2 = 8
```

## Functional Programming in JavaScript and TypeScript

Modern JavaScript and TypeScript have many features that support functional programming:

### Array Methods

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Functional approach using array methods
const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2);
const evens = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
```

### Optional Types with Maybe/Option

```typescript
type Option<T> = { tag: 'some'; value: T } | { tag: 'none' };

// Creating optional values
function findUserById(id: string): Option<User> {
  const user = database.lookup(id);
  return user ? { tag: 'some', value: user } : { tag: 'none' };
}

// Working with optional values
function displayUserName(userOption: Option<User>): string {
  return userOption.tag === 'some' 
    ? `User: ${userOption.value.name}` 
    : 'User not found';
}
```

## Benefits of Functional Programming

Adopting functional programming principles offers several advantages:

1. **Easier Testing** - Pure functions are simpler to test since they have no side effects
2. **Improved Maintainability** - Immutable data and function composition create more predictable code
3. **Better Concurrency** - Without shared mutable state, concurrent operations become safer
4. **Enhanced Debugging** - Pure functions make it easier to trace code execution

## Getting Started

You don't need to rewrite your entire codebase to benefit from functional programming. Start by:

1. Identifying and eliminating side effects where possible
2. Using array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` instead of loops with side effects
3. Avoiding direct mutation of objects and arrays
4. Creating pure utility functions for common operations

By gradually introducing these principles, you can improve code quality and gain a deeper understanding of functional programming.
